# gedecompress

This is a WIP translation from C++ to Python of the original code by SubDrag that can be found [here](https://github.com/jombo23/N64-Tools/tree/master/GEDecompressor).

Conker appears to use `CompressionType2`.

The code was translated line-by-line; I am yet to understand what it's really doing at a high level. With a better understanding I'm sure the code could be simplified.

TODO: translate the compressor.
